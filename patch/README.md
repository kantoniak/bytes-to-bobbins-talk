# "Right to repair" patch

This is a sample badge discussed during [the talk](https://github.com/kantoniak/bytes-to-bobbins-talk).

## Attaching the patch

There are multiple ways of attaching the patch:
* use black thread to sew around inner edge of the border
* cut patch outline from a wide hook tape, glue it to the back
* use iron-on adhesive like HeatnBond Ultrahold to transfer the patch with an iron ([instructions](https://fabricland.ca/howto/images/instructions-HeatnBond.pdf))

> [!WARNING]
> Got a patch at Hackaday Supercon 2025? The outline printed on the adhesive sheet should be mirrored!
