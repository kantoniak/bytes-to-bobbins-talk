## Notes

Thanks for all the comments and questions over the weekend. I'll keep adding more notes and explanations here as they show up. Follow the repo! 😊

* Download and install [Ink/Stitch shortcuts](https://inkstitch.org/docs/customize/#download-and-import-custom-shortcut-keys) in Inkscape. It's a night and day difference.
* Run a tension test when trying new combo of materials. [Good explanation here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDrrf1ooYLw).
* Even if you use a public access machine, you'll enjoy having personal embroidery scissors (small and angled, like Kai N5100). Mark them "Fabric only".
